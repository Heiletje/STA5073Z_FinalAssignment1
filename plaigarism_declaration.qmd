I, Heiletjé van Zyl, declare that this first DS4I assignment titled, “Prediction of Presidents” and the work presented in it is my own. I confirm that:

- This work was done wholly while in candidature as an accredited course to obtain a degree at this University.
- The contents of this assignment has not been previously submitted for a degree or any other qualification
at this University or any other institution.
- Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
- Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of
such quotations, this assignment is entirely my own work.
- I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
